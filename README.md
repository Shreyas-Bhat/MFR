# MFR

* Working on creating ArcFace-based pipeline for masked face verification. Used computer vision techniques to synthetically generate masked face images in the training data
* Further, using explainable AI techniques to the model such as Ablation Cam to view the learnt feature maps and representations.
* Project done as part of BITS F464 Machine Learning.
